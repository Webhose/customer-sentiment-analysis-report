It's not quite the game changer the Quest 2 was, but it is still a solid generational improvement. I went with the 512GB one even though I feel fairly extorted having to choose between paying an extra $150 or having to deal with swapping out apps all the time due to very low drive space. Quest 2 was only $50 extra for 256GB which was great. By the time I get all the accessories to make this thing more comfortable I'll probably have a little over $800 into it. Compared to the about $450 I had for a fully decked out Quest 2 with lots of aftermarket accessories I'd say we are entitled to some fairly high expectations. Also on that note I will say that if you're tight on cash Quest 2 is still a great option because this doesn't really have very many must have features right now. Perhaps once the software catches up with the hardware, but I kind of expect the quest 4 to be around the corner from whenever that happens. I'm somewhat of an enthusiast and I've blown more money in stupider ways than this, so I'm on board.\nThe Good\n-I like how it is thinner and sits with a better center of gravity. It makes a big difference with how it sits on your face and I'm sure when I get an after market headstrap it will be much more comfortable.\n-The higher resolution, the pancake lenses, the higher refresh rate, the wider field of view. These are all things that are easy to write off as minor, but then you realize how much of a difference these are making when you put a Quest 2 back on. Things look very nice and very clear. I'm sure it will only get better as more and more apps add updates to them. So far the updated apps I have tried are a very noticeable improvement. However I have to mention that since they didn't use OLED this time around I still notice the lack of true blacks and a fair amount of bloom in some circumstances.\n-The speakers sound pretty darn good. There are actually 4 this time around and they do a good job with 3d audio.\n-I like the feel of the new controllers and the tracking actually seems a little better during some of the more intense moments of some of the faster paced games like Pistol Whipped.\n-I'm a bigger fan of color passthrough and AR than I thought I would be. I would say that it's still in the early days of this tech though. Pass through is still producing a fairly low res image with lots of warping and distortion. You can't make out text on your computer monitor or phone unless you get extremely close, but it is clear enough to watch a show while you put together a puzzle in one of the apps that's been updated for AR like Puzzling Places and Cubism.\nThe Bad\n-The two biggest things are probably how uncomfortable this is out of the box (I can't wear it for more than an hour before it starts to cause me pain that gets progressively worse to the point of being unbearable) and the battery lasts less than 2 hours most of the time. Sometimes even less than an hour and a half if you're using pass through. I personally don't mind this and even prefer it if it means a much lighter headset because I use BoboVRs halo headstrap with hot swappable battery.\n-They left out some improvements that seem odd to me because they wouldn't have cost much especially when you consider the substantial price increase from the Quest 2. The microphone still sounds pretty crappy which is odd considering how Meta seems to be pushing the social aspects of VR pretty hard, bluetooth headphones still have too much lag to use, and there isn't as much RAM as people were expecting which would have come in handy for a lot of things including more multitasking.\nThings I'm Looking Forward To From Metas Next Headset\n-Obviously a better mic, less bluetooth latency, more RAM.\n-Pretty much the stuff the Pro had that they left out here like OLED and face and eye tracking.", "author": "Amazon Customer", "published": "2023-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": "B0CD1JTBSC", "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-RFAFXYHABWY6X", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:46.463+02:00", "deleted": false}

It is definitely sharper and clearer with the new pancake lenses. It was definitely snappier, scanning the room was effortless, and the app load time is faster. The passthrough for mixed reality is way better than the Q2, but still a bit grainy. The controllers were precise and never went astray like the Q2 can. They are a bit smaller than I like, as I have big hands. It is 40% thinner, which fits in my backpack much easier. The fit is so much better and doesn't jostle around. While the Q3 is marginally heavier, it doesn't feel like a big weight on my face, as the strap is much better at distributing weight evenly. I also love the IPD dial and the mask distance to provide space for glasses. The sound is greatly improved with in loudness, clarity, and bass. I use the Link cable, as my computer is equipped with a 4070 ti. Wow, major improvement with clearer visuals and buttery smooth with Lone Echo 2. The Q2 would stutter a bit and the visuals were good, but lots of aliasing. I have the Reverb G2, and it's definitely slightly clearer, but it's bulky and I can't play Quest games on it.\nSo why meh at first? First off I tried the mixed reality. Loved First Encounters, and despite the graininess and minor distortion, it was convincing. I tried an MR title that would play on the Q2, and it looked like trash. Going back to the Q3, it looked far better by comparison. MR apps are few at this time, but I expect as the Apple Vision enters the market, if it ever does, there will be more MR titles for the Q3\nI played my old titles and newer titles on the Q3. The thing about increased clarity is it highlights the muddiness and basic graphics even more. So I was meh and wondered if I made a bad purchase. That was until I played Red Matter 2 optimized for the Q3 and it knocked my socks off. It was so clear, a beautiful texture details, virtually no aliasing, and it played flawlessly without a hiccup. The sound was great and it's nice not to need headphones. It was true immersion, and using a jet pack to go from one platform to another gave me butterflies. I can play VR for hours and not get headaches or sick, so that was my fear of heights. I tried it on the Q2 and the quality difference reduced my feeling of immersion considerably and it looked okay.\nIt's an amazing that a stand-alone VR headset can now produce this quality of gaming. The extra $200 is worth it from the Q2 and I would have kicked myself later for cheaping out.\nI will bide my time for the new updates and titles. The tech is here, and the software is over the next year. The Q2 with all its updates and increased performance is going to get dated really quickly when the new titles come out. The apps for Q3 are larger, and the same size for the Q2-without the benefit of improved graphics. I pre-ordered to get Asgard's Wrath 2 for free. I can't wait!\nMy 4 instead of 5 stars is because the controllers are small, and the haptics are still not strong enough.

The sweet spot is a bit bigger. Just a bit. It's still very much there. You can tell when trying to read fine text. However, outside the sweet spot is so much clearer than previously that it's easy to do a quick try on and think it's gone. It's not. But still very much better than then Q2. I'd say it's the biggest game changer for me.\n2. Screen door effect. I can't think that I noticed one at all in the hours I've worn the HMD so far.\n3. God rays. I've not noticed any, but I've also not played in any particularly dark environments.\n4. Dark levels. Seems about the same as the previous generation.\n5. Default Head strap fit. Much better than previous generation but I will be buying a 3rd party strap at some point. Its good enough for now though.\n6. Built in sound. WAY better. Still going to use headphones personally but I can see the improvement there. I could, in a pinch, use them without hating it.\n7. Battery life. Same as previous generation and by that, I mean not great.\n8. Increased screen resolution is nice.\n9. Increased FOV is so slight you won't really notice much but it's nice to know it's there.\n10. Color Passthrough. Its grainier than some of the videos online make it seem. Can you read your computer monitor? I can't. Can you read your phone screen? Maybe if you get the distance an angle just right. Is it better than the previous black and white pass through? Very much yes.\nOverall thoughts. Not as hyped as people made it out to be. But what is? The quest 3 is a good generational upgrade over the Quest 2 for enthusiast. And a fantastic jumping on point for newcomers.

Here is my 2 cents on Quest 3.", "text": "The media could not be loaded. If you have upgraded from Quest 1 to Quest 2. You know it was night and day. Quest 2 in simple terms is a true successor of Quest 1. Where everything improved from Quest 1 in leaps and bonds.\nWell, Quest 3 on the surface feels more of a Quest 2.5 but with so, so much potential to be a true successor of Quest 2. All it needs is a few good mix reality games, and a few patches from Meta! The hardware is decent enough. The software already shown a flash of brilliance of what's to come.\nPros:\n- More clear and brighter than Quest 2. (Finally at the point it rivals my bottom of the line duo PC monitors)\n- Bigger Field of View than Quest 2. (You can google up the details it's noticeable not game changing to me)\n- Graphics card is suppose to be 2 times the power of Quest 2. (Mostly future proof here)\n- Good enough Mix Reality pass through. (Played the free mix reality game First Encounter the Headset came with and it below my mind. I can't wait to show this to everyone I know. I suspect for someone like my wife who is not into Virtual Reality, she might actually enjoy the Mix Reality games.)\n- Wide selection of IPD adjustment instead of 3 size fits all for Quest 2.\n- Able to adjust the lens closer or further away from your eyes without having to add an additional attachment like Quest 2. (If you want immersion you can push the lens super close to your eyes. If your wearing glasses simply adjust it further from the eyes without removing the gasket like you need to with Quest 2!)\nNeutral\n- Headset suppose to be lighter and more comfortable. It's defiantly lighter but I personal find the Gasket shape is a bit too narrow for my face, I do have a above average size face but not the BIGGEST by any means. I have to hard press the headset into my face in order to flat out Gasket. Unlike Quest 2 which fits like a glove. By the way I'm using the elite strap so it's not because I'm using the cheap default strap. (Personally I look forward to the 3rd party accessories from Kiwi. I had great experience with them in the past with Quest 2 so really hope they'll pull through.\nCon\n- Mix Reality is good enough but it's no way as clear as the Influencers hyped it to be nor looks like the Meta ads you been seeing! If you do not have perfect lighting condition it's going to be a bit grainy to very grainy. (We are talking about bunch of LED lights turning your room into bright sunny day then it won't be grainy) Now even if you have perfect lighting condition it's not going to be how things look like in the ads as the imagines are far from being sharp, it's just acceptable. (Fyi When mix reality is recorded it always appears to be more clear so don't be fooled!)\n- Default strap.. Just like Quest 2 the strap that come with it's a joke. Factor in the head strap cost when you purchase the headset.\nNow as someone who workout with Quest 2 on a daily basis, and runs a small VR youtube channel upgrade from Quest 2 to Quest 3 is a no brainer. But to the average consumer here are my thoughts to your important questions:\nIf you DO NOT own a headset should you buy Quest 2 or Quest 3?\nAnswer: Quest 3 without a doubt. The quality of life alone are worth the extra $.\nIf you own a Quest 2 should you upgrade?\nAnswer: If money not much of a concern then go for it. If $ is a concern than might want to wait a bit for the software to catch up before pulling the trigger. Also Pico 5 is rumored to come out in early 2024 I suspect they'd want to one up Meta and Quest 3.\nIs there going to be sale Black Friday/ New Year?\nAnswer: I don't know for certain but Quest 2 did get a discount until Quest 3 about to come out so I highly doubt there are going to be monetary discount. Maybe if the sales are really below target Meta might throw in an extra game or 2? I highly doubt it's going to be like the Quest Pro because they wayyyy overpriced that thing.\nAnyhow I hope this review is helpful, and help you see through all the hypeeee from all the influencers who received a FREE headset.

A lot of pros and a few cons:\nPros:\n- Visuals: I could immediately tell the visuals where much sharper. Worth the upgrade alone.\n- Boundary setup: It has the ability to automatically create the boundary, amazing feature! Quite useful if furniture gets moved around, or you want to change play area and not spend 30min on boundary setup...\n- Tracking (controllers + hands): Speaking of tracking it's pretty good. The hand tracking is a cool feature for Mixed reality/passthrough. I've have issues with the Rift where a hand would go flying off into the distance, haven't had that happen yet...\n- Passthrough + Mixed reality: Very cool feature that I've never experienced before. While the passthrough can be grainy it's enough to be able to see things around me. Will have to experiment with this feature.\n- Mic: Better then the Rift but quite sensitive. Don't breath too heavy or it can pick it up.\nNeutral:\n- Audio: Rift had actual speakers you could put onto your ear. Seems Meta swapped to speaker on the headset but they don't cover the ear. Doesn't feel as immersive or powerful as the audio isn't going directly into the ear. I could be wearing it wrong too. There is a 3.5mm jack so I may look into earbuds/headset worse case.\nCons:\n- Comfort: Can last maybe an hour before face starts to get uncomfortable. Could be I'm wearing it wrong or the face plate material is rough.\n- Battery: To use the headset it needs to be charged (even for PCVR). Battery maybe lasts 2hr depending on what your doing. Doesn't charge much while playing PCVR so I have to charge before I can play.\nOverall:\n- Decent headset that will be replacing my Rift for sure. Will be fun experimenting with the Mixed reality and whatnot. Also the Asgard's Wrath code give you the first game too on PCVR so that's cool. Will have 2 new games to play!\nNote: I've read + seen that some people are having issues/defective headsets.

It is decent, but it does tend to be grainy and not as high quality as you might be expecting. More light/studio lights would improve the graininess, but quality is improved slightly. I tested it out in my bathroom as it has the brightest light and it looks great but not as sharp as you see on youtube. I can definetly read my phone at certain angles and a book with good/overhead lighting, but would much prefer without the headset. It is definetly good enough for quick glances on phone messages, and sorta texting depending on your lighting situation.\nThe strap is still not the best, but the headset feels more balanced. I only had pain on my forehead like other reviewers have mentioned but only until i perfectly adjusted the strap (I'd still want to change the strap for a 3rd party one though). The facial interface does not have nose cover flaps which I did noticed light sometimes when not fully focused on the game/dark atmosphere, but would definetly be resolved with some 3rd party facial interface... which just adds more to the cost sadly.\nDespite those cons, the things that I am really happy about are: clarity/sharpness of the lenses (even though some games are lowerish resolution I can still notice the difference of it not being blurry), the manual ipd adjuster, color passthrough is pretty cool even though quality is okay, speaker volume is louder , and the F.O.V.!!!!!, which are very nice upgrades from the quest 2.", "author": "Francis N.", "published": "2023-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review_foreign-R3TSS9LC497JYQ", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:47.076+02:00", "deleted": false}

To be honest, the primary reason I bought the Quest 3 was for the pancake lenses - and I can honestly say it was worth it alone for that. With the Quest 3 I can look around in-game while keeping my head still and actually read in-game text and see objects clearly. There's no more constantly repositioning the headset to get the sweet spot.\nWhat's good about the Quest 3:\n- FOV is 110 degrees. While still not like real life FOV, it's now good enough that I don't notice the missing peripherals.\n- 120FPS refresh rate is butter smooth.\n- Air Link works butter smooth with regular $80 Linksys Wifi 6 mesh router. No need for wired connections, allowing me to spin around without getting tangled up.\n- Smaller headset, not as bulky.\n- Controllers no longer have giant rings on the top.\n- Color passthrough Augmented Reality, allowing me to do things without removing the headset.\n- Sound quality from shotgun speakers much better than Quest 2.\n- Much More powerful CPU/GPU.\n- No Screen door effect whatsoever.\nThe Bad:\n- Passthrough visual quality is quite grainy. You can read text if it's a couple feet away from the front cameras, but it does not look like what is shown on many Youtube reviews. Even in a very well lit room the passthrough is grainy.\n- Battery life is worse than a 3-year old Quest 2, getting somewhere between 1-2 hours depending on what you're doing.\n- The default head strap is utter garbage, just like the Quest 2's. Coincidentally, there are lots of good (if not overpriced) 3rd party head straps available on Amazon already.\nConclusion:\nOverall the Quest 3 is a decent upgrade and fixes most of the problems I had with the 2. The price tag is hard to swallow compared to what the Quest 2 sold for at launch, but given the rapidly declining purchasing power of our funny money - the higher price tag isn't surprising.\nDespite its shortcomings, the Quest 3 is actually a very good headset. It's a jack of all trades, master of some. The fact that I can play VR games on Steam without any wires is worth bragging about. I could also do that with the Quest 2, but now I can actually read text and look around and focus on things with clarity while in-game.\nIt's worth noting the headset can get warm during use. It has a fan inside, but I can't say I've noticed it at all. The default facial interface lets some light bleed from below, around the nose area. Coincidentally enough, You can buy an overpriced memory foam silicone interface from Meta here on Amazon, since the cloth material of the default interface is meh.\nThe controller tracking is about the same as the Quest 2, which is to say fast movements in fitness games may cause sync issues. That was one problem I had with the Quest 2 that hasn't been addressed, but for most applications there are no issues so it is what it is.\nI think 4/5 stars is an accurate rating. The battery life is the only reason I won't give it 5 stars.", "author": "Fredo", "published": "2023-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review_foreign-RUJ47B1LK7HG7", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:47.105+02:00", "deleted": false}

The Quest 3 is a real improvement over the Quest 2 in almost every way, fit, feel, visuals, sound etc. And while it doesn\u2019t have some of the more advanced features the Quest Pro has, such as local dimming for deeper blacks and eye tracked foveated rendering, it does still hold it\u2019s own against the Quest Pro with slightly crisper visuals and better colour pass through especially under good external lighting conditions. Adding to the higher quality colour pass through, the new depth sensor in the Q3 really helps make the mixed reality elements viable, and that was missing from the Quest Pro, so this is a welcome addition. The built in sound with the Q3 is also louder than the Pro and sounds pretty great.\nOn the negative side, the strap which ships with the Q3 is just ok, it gets the job done, but there's something a bit off about the fit, the strap sort of dug into my ears a bit over time. I'm also not the biggest fan of having to re-buy things like the battery strap i own for the Q2 due to Meta changing sizing specs on the Q3. Should also mention the built in microphone is pretty mediocre. Removing a star for this stuff.\nI picked up the 512gb version, though I think most people will be fine with the smaller 128gb version. Also, as mentioned, I grabbed the elite battery strap which really does help with the comfort and balance of the Q3... worth noting that Meta didn't include a simple strap clip for the USB-C battery cable or the Link cable, the Q2 elite battery strap came with one, so that's annoying. So far though, with the updated pancake lenses being a slight step up from the Quest Pro in clarity and field of view, as well as the much improved colour pass through, the streamlined controllers and the addition of the powerful Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2... the Q3 might be the biggest leap in consumer level standalone VR headsets yet... especially for the price.\nAs of right now, this will become my main standalone headset\u2026 while my Quest Pro will become more dedicated to PC VR due to the local dimming for deeper blacks and comfort levels. If you're like me and own a Quest Pro, I think there is still something to gain from checking out the Q3.", "author": "Hal9001", "published": "2023-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": "B0CD1JTBSC", "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review_foreign-R4HSOLFF4U4UR", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:47.240+02:00", "deleted": false}

The difference should not be understated. When you \"live in\" this thing for a while you really start to appreciate the difference.\nI admit the 512 GB version is a bit too steep of a price for a lot of folks. Maybe there will be a sale at some point? The 128 GB version is on the low side of space. You will be swapping out games with this small space, which is annoying of course, but just due to the quality differences of Quest 2 vs Quest 3, I would still recommend the 128 GB version of Quest 3 instead of the Quest 2. Games are going to be updated to higher quality, and you'll be glad you have the more powerful chip and better lenses.\nI use it for a lot of PC VR, and because of this, the space concern for me is of less concern since I'm not storing a lot of apps directly on the headset. But with the quality this headset offers, even I, a hardcore PC VR fan, see the attraction of just making it simpler and buying the game in the Meta store instead of on Steam! There are still quality differences in a lot of games, so I still take advantage of the Steam sales when I can instead of the Meta store.\nNo matter what you might think of Meta / Facebook and their practices, the truth is that with the Quest 3 they really have a big hit on their hands here. This thing is amazing. The only drawback I see is the short battery life. You'll get 1.5 to 2 hours out of the battery, depending on the settings you use (screen brightness, 120 Hz mode, etc), and depending on the game or app you are running. I realize this adds to the cost, but you can get the upgraded strap with an extra battery. I found this made my playtime a perfect length, roughly doubling it to 3 or 3.5 hours.\nIf you have saved up and only have enough for the Quest 2, I would advise you to save a few more months and then get the Quest 3. I've used both, and at least in my opinion, the quality of life and fidelity differences between the two are worth the extra spend and waiting. At the same time if you are outfitting your kids with multiple headsets, I can understand why going with the Quest 2 may be an attractive alternative due to the price, and potentially the headsets getting a little more beat-up and tossed around.

The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon.

I will DEFINITELY be getting myself one!", "text": "As an owner of the Quest 2, I wasn't too sure how much of an upgrade this would be, but let me tell you, this thing is a significant upgrade that I think is well worth the cost.\nThe way the weight is distributed, this thing feels lighter on my face than the Quest 2 ever did, and while I'm probably still going to buy the BOBOVR strap replacement for the Quest 3 (like I did for my Quest 2), it's not because I think the Quest 3 is uncomfortable to wear. On the contrary, this thing is definitely more comfortable out of the box than the Quest 2 was, so anyone on the fence about comfort can lay those worries to rest immediately.\nI'll be honest: When this thing first arrived and I tried it on, I wasn't wowed like I expected to be by some monumental leap in clarity, crispness, and screen resolution. No, it wasn't until that same night when I used my own Quest 2 again that I was blown away by the difference. Is it a staggering difference? No, it's not. Is it VERY obvious when comparing the new and the old side-by-side? You better believe it.\nThe Quest 3 is more comfortable to wear, improves upon the Quest 2's already impressive motion responsiveness (which is huge for folks who suffer from motion sickness if the scene they're viewing doesn't move *precisely* in lockstep with their head movements), has UNBELIEVABLE hand tracking capabilities (this thing makes the Quest 2 look like a knockoff product in that regard), offers a noticeable bump in clarity and responsiveness, and takes the rudimentary pass-through visibility system from the Quest 2 and instead gives you a true \"I can see everything around me, in color, without visible skewing or synchronization issues\" experience when you're wearing the headset and need to be able to see the world around you.\nHeck, even the built-in speakers (which were already excellent in the Quest 2) got a really nice bump in terms of volume AND fidelity. I don't know if this thing is *actually* louder than the Quest 2 (at max volume), or if it just *sounds* louder because the speakers are positioned more intelligently when you're wearing the headset, but either way it's yet another significant upgrade.\nBottom-Line: The Quest 3 is truly an upgrade over the Quest 2 in every way. This is an absolute home run product for Meta that I think literally everyone who enjoys gaming at any level will enjoy.\nIf you own a Quest 2 and are still in love with the thing, I wouldn't call this a \"must buy,\" but I *can* guarantee that you'll be significantly impressed by the upgrade should you choose to pull the trigger.\nAs for anyone who's never owned a VR headset and is on the fence about taking the plunge? I'll just say this: Back when the Quest 2 was first released in 2020 I told anyone who would listen that right then was *the* time to get into VR. The Quest 3 just made 2020 me look foolish, because this thing is a slam dunk experience, and NOW is objectively the time to hop on the VR train.

The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.", "author": "Val", "published": "2023-11-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 5.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R3SQYMAURQS7VN", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:48.607+02:00", "deleted": false}
