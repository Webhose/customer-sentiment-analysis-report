A pretty big one. but it DOES have some good qualities to it.", "text": "SSSOOOOOOOOOO....Let's go ahead and get the cons out of the way and then I'll tell you the good.\nThe biggest HEAT BAD - There is a spot of tech that heats in the top center of the faceplate and I can feel it from forehead, that heat issue is immense and imo dangerous, I don't use any tech that reaches that heat, especially things like phones, battery packs, and chargers, cause ya know, lithium go boom. Heat is bad, and if meta knew this was an issue since quest 2? That's the first thing they should have addressed.\nSecond biggest - for me, visuals are a make or break deal for me. I came from quest 1, this tells you how bad I thought their visuals were. I connect to pc, my quest 1 has outdone quest 2 for a long while, and I thought maybe quest 3 could outdo it. No. The overall sharpness increases, that's where the good dies, I will reiterate that later. The pancake lenses are cool and all, but when you look outside of direct center of your visuals you get a very bad dark ring in the lenses. LCD screens are 90s tech that never got better really. The overall colors are washed 100 too many times, the ingame and inmenu colors are all darker than they should be, like brightness went to die. I could not stand it for very long, it was that bad.\nThird - BATTERY, I read the stuff online and I was like \"ok, cool, but how's it while plugged in?\" Same deal, and adds to the heat issue from 1. The heat exists with or without plug, it's a couple degrees difference. Bad battery, won't last. 3 hours is not acceptable as a time limit, and if you really want to make a standalone, make it last alone longer than 6 hours while operating at the full capacity, if it can't do that, it's kinda not worth it. If you guys can't make a headset that can stand alone, make it pc locked, but increase the efficiency of the energy transfer and focus on heat mitigation.\nfourth - less relevant, but they need to stop with the non-halo straps, it's like 10 bucks worth of plastic you cheap people, 20-40 if you're doing it right and making quality >>.. that's something that should be mandatory.\nfive - the controllers are harder to use due to the wide head size and I have no idea why you guys thought it was a good thing to make the top like that.\nsix - the depth sensor actually hurt the color camera performance, you would have been way better off just leaving it off and letting it stick to optional zooming in and out controlled by the user.\nseven - tutorial voice super annoying, have option to do text or speech tutorial, or better yet, a friggin skip button!\nSo, now that's out of the way for the main bad points, here's the some good\nTracking is REALLY a huge step up from before, the controllers are really good at placement from what I know.\nthe fps is actually a decent upgrade as well, smoothness was nice.\nthe color passthrough was actually kinda nice for like 2 minutes.\nit had a lot of potential. who knows, maybe with some software tweaks, the depth sensor won't be a detriment, and maybe it'll be an unexpected grower like the quest 1 was. But if my quest 1 still lives and outperforms it on the visuals and battery life while not overheating?

Indeed, the pancake lens is the standout feature of the Quest 3. It has a large sweet spot and no issues with aberration or other lens-related problems.\nCons:\n- Resolution: It's quite close to the Reverb G2. I wasn't expecting a \"screen door\" effect, but it's noticeable.\n- Heat Generation: It produces a significant amount of heat.\n- Battery: I couldn't even play for 2 hours straight. For my gaming sessions, an external battery pack is necessary.\n- Facial Interface: It feels cheap, is too narrow, and the pressure is not evenly distributed. Most of the pressure is concentrated at the top, which isn't ideal given the weight of the headset.\n- Straps: They seem cheap and are barely usable. In my opinion, an aftermarket strap is essential, which increases the overall cost.\n- Pass-Through: It's somewhat usable, but it's far from a high-quality \"mixed-reality\" experience.\n- PC VR Gaming: Videos have to be compressed, which consumes GPU and CPU resources. Often, this compression degrades the image quality.\n- FOV - it's a bit better comparing to quest 2, but it's very minor improvement. Probably it's even good for this price range.\nOverall: Compared to the Quest 2, it's a step forward, but the only significant improvement is the lenses. Other upgrades are minor. Considering the price tag \u2013 which is $500 for 128GB, and given the need for an extra battery, better head straps, and a superior facial interface, which can raise the price to around $700 \u2013 the value for money isn't impressive.

I read all the specs of the Q3 and ordered one, excited about the boost in graphics power.\nThe good:\n* The GPU in the Q3 is pretty awesome, I could push the Eleven Table Tennis (ETT) graphics almost to the max and it stayed pretty much rock-solid at 120FPS.\n* Although not really my cup of tea, Mixed Reality is really cool, and if my focus wasn't ETT, then I would have likely used it more.\n* It's light, noticeably so compared to the Q2\n* The picture is bright, and the lenses are a big improvement over the Q2. IMHO, based on the numbers, the FOV is a little better than the Q2, however it feels MUCH wider to me.\nThe not so good:\n* The facial interface is way less comfortable to me as compared to the Q2.\n* The battery drains a lot more quickly as compared to the Q2, but that's probably a trade-off for the enhanced graphics. Compromise is a thing.\nThe BAD:\n* If you are a competitive table tennis player, then you probably want to use an adapter to make the simulator feel more like real life. Meta, in their infinite wisdom, decided to do away with the rings found on the Q2 controllers. This causes the IR LEDs to face away from the headset, and it loses tracking.\nTracking loss is a BAD thing for ETT, it causes you to miss-hit the ball, whiff completely, or you may even watch as your paddle floats away from your body. That's cute and all, but not so good if you're playing a competitive sport. Just sayin'... :)\nMy guess is that Meta got cute and tried to use some sort of advanced AI algorithm and hand tracking to predict where the controllers are when it loses tracking.\nThis DOES NOT WORK for apps like ETT that require your arms to move fast, and where millimeters count.\nI'm also guessing that no amount of software gymnastics can fix this issue because the Q3 controllers have an inherent flaw. If they ever make the Q3 backwards compatible to Q2 controllers, that may fix the problem, but I'm only guessing.\nSo back the Q3 went to Amazon.

Let me list them:\n- Carrying case ( it comes in a cute box, why not add in the case as well? why not ship it in the case instead?) it costs 70 usd currently.....\n- Charging dock ( understandable but it costs 130 dollars...... wireless chargers go for 15 dollars) the quest is also a clunky piece of equipment. It should come with a stand or something similar. Not surprisingly, the dock is perfect for this issue..... like... you see what I'm saying? My point?\n- Active straps 40 usd ( again, why not ship with the device? its perfect for it so why not include it you're supposed to be active so it would make sense to include it, no?)\n- Active facepiece- silicone- 40 usd ( again, why not include it? its not that expensive and you're supposed to be active right? )\n- The one that's the worst. The one that I think Meta should be sued for. A class action lawsuit at least. The \"Elite Strap\" that sells for a whopping 70 usd 130 with an extra battery included on the strap. How is it elite? It's what's supposed to come with the device, that's how. I'm not even joking. Anyone can attest to the fact that the head strap that comes with any meta headset is injury inducing. It feels terrible and uncomfortable. By design? Yes. It was the same for quest 2. It couldn't have been a mistake. The cheapest Quest 3 is already 500 plus taxes so 540 for most people. 540 for what, exactly? A device that's lacking. Meta knows this and sells \"bundles\" with the correct attachments. Its a joke. The product is nice, cool but this issue needs to be addressed.\nThe software is ok. Besides the accessory issue, it runs somewhat expected. A billion dollar company and its software still lacks.\n- The native meta link ( cable and air) pale in comparison to the 3rd party apps sold on the store. Of course, you have to pay more to fix issues that come with the quest. Such a joke. In order to connect your pc and quest, you can the buggy, terrible native software or use exceptional but still lacking 3rd party software. Nice.\nOverall, I've enjoyed using it. Sometimes I feel like a sailor looking through a scope, but still, its cool. I'd only recommend, if you feel like supporting this type of, \"pay for part, buy the rest later\" type of mentality companies have. Like a game without the much, much needed dlc. If you want to be a pay pig, if you want to pay 2-3 hundred more for the needed accessories, then buy it, if not, then do not. Buy the quest 2 for 500 and get everything you'd need instead of this dare I say, cash grab? Make a good product and then make a better one, but split it into pieces and charge even more. sigh.....", "author": "mike", "published": "2023-10-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 3.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R1Y5EIG6OU399R", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:43.872+02:00", "deleted": false}

It wasn't uncommon to hit your other hand/controller with those.\n- Scroll for focal width is much better than quest 2 (quest 2 was a downgrade from the first gen in this regard with just a few rigid positions).\nThe Bad:\n- BIG price hike. If I didn't have a $100 gift card already, I Iikely would have just stayed with the quest 2 and waited for other vendors to compare before buying.\n- Not enough memory on base model and too much money for bigger storage model\n- Uncomfortable fit as is. I really expected more with a big price hike and the quest 2 fit better out the box to me. You shouldn't HAVE to buy aftermarket and they made it so you can't use previous headstraps on the new headset. We really should have a class action on this one and Meta needs to make up for this going forward or I'll be definitely be looking at other vendors.\n- I have notable light leakage around nose now compared with previous headsets.\nNeutral:\n- I don't really notice field of view improvements but I didn't switch back and forth between headsets to figure out and I would have bought this headset without that improvement (as long as other items improved).\nI have another negative but I'm not sure where to attribute it. The most frequently used game by me is Thrill of the Fight - a boxing game. At the same time as the new headset drop, there was a game update. I've noticed my punches are registering completely differently than before and I'm fairly confident one of my power punches is being greatly mis-tracked. I have many years of striking experience for what it's worth. I haven't yet got into other games to help deduce the issue.

This was my first VR headset and I was really excited to use it.\nAmazon did it's job at the finest. Delivered from USA to India in record 8 days. Amazon service is highly recommended\nOTOH, quest 3, not so much.\nThere are tons of reviews on the good stuff. All of those are true. Great VR, the mixed reality mode is good (if you have good lighting), etc. etc.\nWhy is it bad\n1. The headset is freaking uncomfortable to wear. One of the main use-cases (that can justify the price tag for me) was to use it for work (in a multiple monitor setup), i.e., use it in horizon workrooms. If it is very uncomfortable, we cannot. There is no way I can last more than 30mins at one time. The headaches are terrible.\n2. Compatibility issues:\nA. We have quest-link support, but ONLY for PCs? Why? Why not for MAC OS?\nB. We have quest-link, but horizon workrooms use ONLY wireless? Why would facebook depend on a lousy wireless connection for professional work? Did the product manager even think what he/she was doing?\n3. We have IPD adjustment wheel, but NO tool to know which is the right setting. For me, adjusting the wheel didn't change the comfort/ease of eyes/etc. Why cannot we have some app to guide through this\n4. Because the headset is uncomfortable to wear, using it for coding (where we need to read text), is very difficult.\n5. I can take a $100 tablet and watch movies on it at night turning off the lights. I try the same thing with quest 3, and I failed. You CANNOT do anything on the quest 3 in dark. How can this be used in long-flights? Who designed this broken ****?

Even with brightness on about 1/2 and pass through off the battery is dead is about an 1-1.5 hours. I primarily use Airlink with a PC and I just leave an external battery connected.

At least the Quest 3 is uncomfortable enough that I usually want to take it off before I can kill the battery.\nThe resolution is higher than the 2 and the lenses are now pancake lenses instead of the old school Fresnals. The pancake lenses on the 3 are by far the biggest upgrade over the Quest 2.\nOther upgrades the 3 offers are actual IPD adjustments and in my opinion better built in audio.

I \u201cupgraded\u201d from the 2 and shouldn\u2019t have bothered. I travel internationally and got the 3 thinking it would be a substantial upgrade after waiting a few years for Meta to release it.

The visuals are much sharper, immersion works better without increasing vertigo, tracking is leaps and bounds better, and the controllers (clones from the Quest Pro, I think) are a great improvement. One of the best things (for me) is the new room-mapping software; it 3D maps your play space--including floors, walls, ceilings, and obstacles--automatically and very quickly. You can still manually set the floor height and draw an area if you want, and you can edit anything the headset maps. It's really a great function that lets you set up pretty much anywhere very easily. Meta and its partners are also supposedly hard at work updating and optimizing their gaming library to take advantage of the 3's improved processing and display capabilities. Red Matter 2 was ready at launch, and...DANG; the difference is kinda stunning. The new pass-through view is improved, too. It's a full color mixed or \"augmented reality\" (AR) setup, where you see the real room you're in and a scaled-down version of the menus grafted over it. This view is a higher resolution than the old grayscale IR passthrough, but it's still a little grainy. Given the limitations of the sensors and cameras Meta used, this wasn't surprising, but still, you shouldn't expect 4K resolution outside of actual applications.\nOnto problems; the main ones being the battery and the interface menu (OS). The battery sucks. Like...a lot. I drained it from full to less than 20% in less than 90 minutes playing \"Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge.\" I could get over 2 hours on a single charge out of the Quest 2. Less resource-intensive games did a little better; \"Superhot\" lasted just about two hours, and dorking around in the included tutorial games did about the same. It feels like they kept the battery from the 2 when an upgrade was clearly called for. This could be a QC issue; maybe the battery in my particular headset is just a little off or something, but from other reviews I've seen, this seems to be the norm. The user interface (UI) is the same as the 2 as well; as in, identical. Same menu placements, settings, everything. I can understand why, since the 3 came out very quickly compared to other VR headsets, and Meta obviously wanted to focus on performance increases, which they did very well. But...come on; at least a new look for the UI would have been nice. The headset is also a few grams heavier than the 2, which becomes noticeable after about half an hour of playing. The facemask (point of contact with your face) is cloth, and if you work up a sweat, it will be absorbed. That's a hygiene issue that could have been addressed; the Quest 2 came with a silicone gasket cover specifically for this, but the 3 did not have one included. The included headstrap is a great improvement over the original iterations, but still not great. Meta has a $70 \"elite\" option, but there are already aftermarket options available at a fraction of the price.\nDespite the issues, it's hard to beat at this price point, especially if you want VR untethered.", "author": "OneRaisedEyebrow", "published": "2023-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 3.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R33NYFZZZ9F58W", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:44.183+02:00", "deleted": false}

The mixed reality, despite showing a pretty grainy video feed of our living room, was really cool and magical\u2014reminded me of the awe I felt when I first tried the original Quest back in 2019. Our walls came apart, and beyond them we could see a beautiful space desert scene from another planet, with little aliens jumping through into our home. Very trippy. And how it scans and maps the room into polygons made me feel like I was in the Matrix for a moment.\nI also played a bit of Red Matter 2, which has been optimized with gorgeous lighting, high-res textures, and dynamic shadows. This game looks much closer to PCVR than a standalone headset, but to be fair it already looked awesome on Q2. Now it's just dialed up a few notches for an even bigger wow factor.\nBut all that aside, I dunno if it's enough to warrant the $950 I spent on it. It feels like an incremental step forward rather than a generational leap. Will def need to play it a lot the next couple weeks and decide if it's worth keeping. I can't help but think that for $200 less I could buy a PS5, which absolutely WOULD blow my mind.\nBit of background: I have Q1 and Q2, and though I also wasn't super blown away by the Q2 when I first got it (Meta really needs to understand the importance of great titles that take advantage of new hardware being available at launch), there was no going back to the Q1 after it. This one so far is a big enough letdown that I do think I could go back to the Q2 pretty easily. Perhaps when new games and experiences come out that really showcase what it can do I'll feel a lot different about it, but I was hoping that the Q3 VR experience would feel drastically better right out of the box.\nWhile the new lenses are much nicer and clearer, I can't say I really notice much of a wider FOV, the black levels look exactly the same as they did on the Q2 (which kinda ruins games that are supposed to be scary), and I don't find it all that comfortable to wear. Considering the premium price Meta is charging, no one should have to be buying additional straps and accessories. Period.\nI find a lot of these issues unacceptable to the point where I am seriously considering holding out for whatever the next iteration has in store for us instead.

Graphics on the Quest 3 are a major improvement over the Quest 2 as well as the sound. You do not need additional headphones for the Quest 3 like you did on the Quest 2. Graphics are excellent and the FOV is much improved. Gone is the sweet spot that you had to achieve in the Quest 2. In the Quest 3 every view is the sweet spot and text is much more clear and Quest 3 enhanced games look fantastic and run much smoother. The new pancake lenses with the improved resolution really makes the Quest 3 shine in the graphics fidelity department when compared to the Quest 2.\nThe mixed reality is excellent and is really a lot of fun. I had a bunch of family and friends over for Thanksgiving and they could not get enough of Drop Dead: The Cabin Home Invasion. Games like Red Matter 2 now blur the line between PC VR and standalone Quest games. I would say Red Matter 2 looks just as good as Lone Echo 2 which is a PC VR game. Not quite as good as Half Life Alyx however but still pretty darn great.\nThe room setup is much easier as it now automatically scans the room and the headset feels much more comfortable although you will need to upgrade the head strap as the stock head strap is junk. I highly recommend the Bobovr M3 with the additional battery packs which leads me to the reason I took off a star: Battery life and out of the box comfort.\nBattery life is abysmal especially in mixed reality mode. Expect 90 minutes or less which is a real bummer if you have friends over wanting to take turns playing a mixed reality game like Drop Dead: The Cabin Home Invasion.\nThe Quest 3 would be a 5 star product even at the $500+ price point if Meta would do two things out the box: Increased battery life and a more comfortable head strap. Because of these two problems expect to spend another $100 to fix these issues. There are many third party solutions and the one I recommend is the Bobovr M3 which is ultra comfortable and has swappable battery packs. I also recommend getting a more comfortable silicone facial interface that you can clean.\nIf you can swing the additional cost for the third party head strap and silicon facial interface then I highly recommend the Quest 3 even if you currently have a Quest 2. Also I would go for the 512 GB version if you can swing the additional cost.

The clarity is amazing and makes all of the visuals so much better.\nThe field of view is also much improved and adds quite a bit more immersion.

Disappointing that it didn't come with something better for the price but there are affordable headstraps to improve this.\nGame library for users who have already used vr quite a bit is lacking but there looks to be some great new games on the horizon.\nBattery life is not very long when using pass-through. So games that use AR will drain battery quick.\nOverall the Oculus Quest 3 is a great headset that is hugely improved from the previous meta headsets with a few cons that can be fixed with additional accessories and time.", "author": "Anthony Fernandez", "published": "2023-11-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R3KK33EXXIT0FF", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:44.861+02:00", "deleted": false}

Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\nPros -\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\nCons\nDisplay\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\nComfort\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\nEcosystem\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\nPassthrough\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.", "author": "Michael", "published": "2023-11-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R13B1J6J7UMJIE", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:45.077+02:00", "deleted": false}

My first VR headset was the Steam Index and I fell in love within minutes of putting on the device but being tethered to a wire was always frustrating, even when those wires are attached to the ceiling for a more comfortable playtime. I bought the Quest 2 out of sheer curiosity and was impressed with the wireless experience. Passthrough gave me a headache but was pretty cool to be able to see my surroundings without taking the headset off. The Pro felt like a game changer with color passthrough, a more comfortable design and pancake lenses that really makes a difference in image quality but the Pro wasn't really made for the regular VR consumer market and the original price point proved that. The Quest 3 on the other hand feels like a mix between the 2 and the Pro. You have most of the features and tech of the Pro with a few extras with the minimalist design of the 2.\nNow onto the review. Color passthrough on the Quest 3 is good but not great. For me it feels a little better than the Quest Pro but not by much. It's still grainy at the best of times but good enough that you can tell what you're looking at. Looking at other digital objects is much better in my opinion, as with the Pro I constantly had to move my phone around to get a decent view whereas the 3 you pretty much can see without much movement.\nQuest 3, though not perfect, has a very innovative room scale system that scans the room automatically and can be set up to continue to scan in case you move about your surroundings. What makes this cool is that while the headset scans your surroundings games and apps can take advantage of this information and then can use it to mesh with whatever assets are in the game or app. Think a shooter where the NPCs can hide behind your chair or couch. I have not tested this yet but from what I've seen of others it seems to work quite well but with a few hiccups.\nImage quality is better than the Quest Pro and with the pancake lenses glare is almost nonexistent. Blacks are not as dark as the Pro but not enough of a difference to warrant a bad score. In fact I had issues with certain games on the Pro where it was too dark and I wasn't able to see or had any indication where I needed to go because again I couldn't see it was so dark.\nQuest 3 controllers are also a mix between the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro. The loop thing from the Quest 2 controllers have been removed and are now the same size of the Quest Pro's controllers but the Pro has tracking sensors built into the controllers whereas the Quest 3's controllers do not. Controllers still track very well though probably not as well as the Pro controllers. The Quest Pro controllers are compatible with the Quest 3 so that is an option, just know that battery life on the Quest Pro controllers are much less than the controllers the Quest 3 comes with.\nSound seems better from the Quest 2 but about the same on the Quest Pro. Both the Quest Pro and Quest 3 have headphone jacks for better options in the sound department. I've not tested either as I'm content with the default headset speakers.\nComfort on the Quest 3 is basically the same as the Quest 2. You can play with the headset out of the box with the strap it comes with but you're going to want to buy a better one in the future. The Quest 3 though is a lighter headset which means it doesn't put as much strain on the front of your face and in turn can be worn a little longer without fatigue setting in as quickly. I purchased the Bobovr M3 head strap and the difference is night and day in comfort and batteries are hot-swappable. Just know that the default head strap will get the job done but if you're going to play with the Quest 3 for long lengths of time then you'll almost certain need a better head strap.\nAir Link I haven't fully tested but seems to work better in my opinion. This mostly depends on other factors but I have a pretty decent PC and ran into some slight issues when I used it on the Quest 2. With the Quest 3 I was able to see my Steam library and run an app or two and it all seemed very smooth. I'll be testing this more out in the future and will update this review if needed.\nThose that wear glasses, it will depend on how big your glasses are on whether you'll need to purchase prescription inserts. My glasses are fairly large and caused me to have to force the Quest 3 headset on my face, and then carefully take it off. Thankfully it only cost me around $50 to purchase inserts but that is another expense for some and a difficult thing to ask when this headset is already $500. You can also purchase third party face plates but I have no knowledge of that. For those curious, Zenni Optical is where I bought my inserts. They take a couple of weeks but in my opinion are worth the wait and price.\nAll in all the Quest 3 is a very capable VR headset with a lot of features and tech that should keep it around for several years to come. It may not be as huge a leap from the Quest Pro but it's certainly worth an upgrade from the Quest 2. Is the Quest 3 worth it? I think that all depends. For me I do more than play games and I like carrying this around rather than a laptop but I'm probably a one off when it comes to that. For what this headset can do I think it's worth the price but I know not everyone is the same. If you're curious about VR and don't want to take the leap in getting a Quest 3 then the Quest 2 might be more up your alley, if you need more RAM and have cash to burn then get the Quest Pro, but if you want the latest tech without wires in VR and don't mind being an early adopter then the Quest 3 might be a good fit for you. Just know that it feels as if the default out of the box product you receive as the Quest 3 seems to be meant as a starting point. Meaning the device feels as if Meta designed it so that the consumer would have to upgrade for comfort, battery life or whatever else the consumer wants changed to better suit their experience. Basically the VR headset cost $500 but it's almost a guarantee you'll have to spend more depending on what you want added. Though it is possible to enjoy the headset without spending more but you'll need a high tolerance for discomfort.\nI doubt my mind will change drastically with this device but just in case it does I will edit this review accordingly.", "author": "Nersciple", "published": "2023-11-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R1KKPU4DCHWDW5", "is_verified": false, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:45.146+02:00", "deleted": false}

The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.", "author": "Neil", "published": "2023-11-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R13DXHQKLQVEWD", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:45.169+02:00", "deleted": false}

I upgraded Quest 3 because of MR, but after reading the youtuber\u2019s review and trying it myself, I have to say that I was a little disappointed. The main reason is that the background of MR is very clear in the video, but in actual use, I found that it was just a blur. It is just to let the black and white of Quest 2 changes to a colorful background, and the resolution is clearer, but you can only read the words on the phone from a close distance, not from a distance! A youtuber once wore Quest 3 to eat in a restaurant and walked on the street. I have to admire his bravery. In fact, it is quite dangerous (based on the background clarity of the MR in actual use). But I need to say, if you already own Quest 2, Quest 3 is an investment worth upgrading to buy. The biggest reason is to add MR! If you don\u2019t buy Quest 3, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy some games or programs that are uniquely designed for MR. Finally, I originally ordered 128GB, but ended up buying 512GB instead.

I would say everything is hovering around that 780-1080P resolution which isn't great in today's standards but its acceptable. Correction: certain youtube videos offer 4k resolution, and with it on, the resolution is incredible.\n~ Passthrough is really cool but it's more for knowing where you are and not for multi-tasking. I don't want to say if it's quality or not because it's my first time using and I don't really have a benchmark to compare it to.\n~ The sound coming from the speakers is actually amazing. Not great bass but way better than what I was expecting. Audio sounds crisp and low distortion. Some claim that noise bleed occurs with the speakers and it is true but it isn't too bad. Fan noise is low too.\n~ Pretty decent selection of free apps.\n~ The hand gestures are great but definitely slower than just using your controller.\nCons:\n~ My unit has incredibly fuzzy passthrough and bad color distortion within the lenses specifically around the corners. I heard multiple suppliers are providing the lenses and cameras and this could explain why there is such a huge variation of quality.\n~ extension of my previous point, unlike what others have said, I cannot read my phone notifications without squinting and I cannot read anything on my desktop browser while using passthrough. The whites are blown out completely unless you're within 0.2ft of the source.\n~ Almost everything physically is white, and white doesn't hold well under dirt and UV sunlight. The unit is guaranteed to look yellow and dirty within a month of constant use.\n~ Even with all the adjustments made, I still have a lot of light bleeding into the headset primarily in the nose piece area (my head is huge for reference).\n~ Everyone has claimed that the new pancake lenses make it so that you won't have eye strain or a headache but for me I get really dizzy around the 30 minute mark and would need to take off the headset to refocus my eyes.\n~ Everyone has already said it, but again, the stock straps suck and the battery life sucks.\n~ The software is still really buggy, there's been multiple times where the controller tracking would just go wild and when the passthrough and VR experience would randomly turn on and off as well as flicker.\n~ The included charging cable is ridiculously short, pretty clear cash grab for you to buy the extended charger.\n~ The price charge for official accessories is ridiculous.\nUltimately, do I regret spending this much money for the meta quest 3? No. However, I do think that once the hype and initial wonder dies down, I would say that it's slightly expensive.", "author": "Sueddo", "published": "2023-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 4.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-RZV6C4I26HN31", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:46.429+02:00", "deleted": false}

I love it!\nBy God this thing is so uncomfortable after an hour of wearing this thing my head hurt. The two adjustment strap rings in the back strap are just annoying and dig into your head.\nHow can they design such a great head set and have it be this miserable to wear. I could wear my rifts for hours with no comfort issues and that was right out of the box.
