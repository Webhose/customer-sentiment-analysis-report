This artifacting occurs about 40% of the time. In SKYBOX VR watching movies via my plex server, it happens about 80% of the time.

They are much smaller without the giant ring and I really like that...someday when the system is playable I'm sure I'll enjoy using them.\nI will day that the fairly stationary Puzzling Places is ok for me to play, and I don't recall having the issues I described above in that game.

Everything seemed great until I was greeted again by the blank screen.\nI did some research online since a few weeks had passed and online forums were starting to catch up to the newly released Quest 3. One person mentioned that the proximity sensor had issues detecting when the headset was on your head. So while I had the headset on my head, I stuck my finger up from the bottom to where the sensor was located in between both eyebrows and surprisingly, the screen came on and everything worked fine. Playing with a finger up my headset was not ideal so I am seriously considering returning the Quest 3.\nI tend to play a lot of action/exercise apps so I usually play with a black skull cap on my head to reduce the amount of sweat that I get on the headset. It seems like the proximity sensor doesn't like either the color or the material as the screen constantly cuts in and out if I adjust my headset even the slightest bit. Playing without a skull cap, I was able to adjust the headset as much as I wanted and the screen stayed on. The Quest 2 did not have this problem.\nI also had a minor issue charging the Quest 3 and official elite head strap with extended battery. Normally you can leave the extended battery plugged into the headset and plug the charging cable into the extended battery in order to charge both.\nI happened to play until the extended battery and headset completely lost battery and shutdown on its own so I left it to charge overnight. The led indicating it was charging came on but the next day, both the headset and extended battery were still at 0% and the headset only showed a low battery symbol.\nI ended up unplugging the elite strap extended battery from the headset and charged them separately. Both are now operating normally and can be charged using just the extended battery charge port.\nLots of weird issues which the Quest 2 did not have and the Meta website was absolutely no help whatsoever. It costs double the price of the Quest 2 and so far there aren't many apps that can use the mixed reality feature so my review still stands at 1 star.\nIt is working for now and I will update if anything elses comes up..\n**ORIGINAL REVIEW**\nSetup was a breeze, all my apps downloaded with no issues and I had a blast for about an hour before being prompted to charge the headset.\nOne hour is all it took to go from 100% down to 2% which was my first disappointment. Maybe the setup and downloading of all the apps is what caused the battery to drain so quickly? Maybe the mixed reality using all the cameras drained the batteries?\nI will never know because after fully charging the headset and powering it on, I was greeted by the Meta logo followed by a black screen. Controllers would not connect and the Meta Quest app would not connect to the headset.\nI tried a factory reset by holding the volume down and power button but was again greeted with the Meta logo followed by a black screen. I tried the factory reset a second time to see if it would help but had the same results.\nWhile I was chatting with Amazon Customer Service, the headset eventually booted up with the setup process but now when I adjust the IPD dial, the screen cuts in and out.\nI LOVED the Meta Quest 2 and I do love this Meta Quest 3 but it seems like they have some kinks to work out. There was no option to exchange the item since apparently it was shipped by Amazon but sold by Meta so I have to return the item before purchasing a new one.\nI will update once I get a working headset..", "author": "JL", "published": "2023-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 1.0, "variant": "B0CD1JTBSC", "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R3DRLZGQ81Z9I9", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:38.324+02:00", "deleted": false}

I held onto my Oculus Rift CV1 for as long as I possibly could and was really looking forward to my first headset with inside-out tracking. Unfortunately, the Quest 3 didn\u2019t deliver. Here are five reasons why I ultimately decided to return it:\n1. Meta is neglecting PCVR\nThe latency induced by playing over Wi-Fi/USB rendered my PCVR games unplayable, and I even own a Wi-Fi 6 router that I was within a few feet from. Also, licenses don\u2019t transfer, so if you own a game on PC and want to play it standalone, you\u2019re forced to purchase it again.\n2. Pass-through is good but not great.\nThere is lots of distortion that isn\u2019t shown in the promos. The pass-through camera is relatively low resolution and performs poorly in low light conditions. I can read my phone if I hold close to my face, but cannot read my computer monitor at arms length. Also the FOV is only 110\u00b0, so it still feels like you are in a simulated environment.\n3. Dev support isn\u2019t there\nIn the past few years, there have only been a handful of notable releases. If you are brand new to VR, there might be enough to keep you busy for a little while, but VR veterans won\u2019t find anything new here except the typical main stays.\n4. The battery isn\u2019t big enough\nYou only get about 1.5 hours of playtime before you need to spend another 2 hours charging the thing which means you\u2019ll almost certainly have to purchase a separate power bank if you want to enjoy the Quest without interruption. That wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it weren\u2019t already so expensive to begin with, which leads me to last point:\n5. It\u2019s too expensive\nFor the same price as the 128GB model, you could get a current gen console plus a few games. It\u2019s ok value if you only consider it as a standalone device only, but as someone with a VR capable PC already, I\u2019d rather not have to pay for he onboard tech I will hardly ever use.\nThat\u2019s why, much to my chagrin, I chose to return my headset. PCVR support, dev support, battery, and pass through were major pain points that should be selling points. Hopefully, another company can fill this hole in the market that Meta has left wide open.", "author": "Christian M.", "published": "2023-11-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 2.0, "variant": "B0CD1JTBSC", "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R3AIQVLY73E1Q2", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:38.947+02:00", "deleted": false}

It keeps getting into a state in which it won't boot. I do want to give Meta some kudos for replacing the unit multiple times, although each cycle requires 10-30 days to get the replacement.\nNevertheless, I do enjoy the Quest and the VR environment, so I was eager to buy the Quest 3 when it came out. It's still early days (I've not had to send it back for replacement yet!), but there are a few important user-visible improvements, including\n1. Improved comfort - the weight is about the same, but the better distribution means it is more comfortable to wear, with less \"pull\" on the front of your face\n2. Improved speed\n3. Improved graphics\n4. MUCH improved exterior cameras for pass through mode and AR games. You can still tell it's a camera, but vastly better than the grey-scale-in-the-dark view from the Q2 cameras\n5. Easier and quicker to set up your boundary.

I bought it from Bestbuy since I could get it on release day, its primarily use was going to be for PCVR and maybe Beatsaber on the headset.\nPros:\n1) Sweet spot is a non issue basically no matter where I put the dial I had a 'clear' image\n2) Controller feel better\n3) Sound improved\n4) No major issues with standalone performance (almost all my issues were when connected to PC)\nCons:\n1) AIRLINK: It's awful. It lags in the menu and in game and progressively gets worse and worse with artifacting then tries to catch up which just jumbles the screen until it locks in for a few more min just to do it all over again. (I have very good PC, good internet speeds and connection(5ghz wifi), and standing within 4 feet of both the computer and router and the PC is connected via Lan) It seems to be a software issue with Airlink, cable its fine. You can apparently use \"virtual desktop\" app for $20 which is more or less a better Airlink but I'm not gonna give more money to the shop because they cant design airlink properly..\n2) Graphics: were overhyped in my opinion. They're better but not that much better. Subjective but I would say it went from 240p on Quest 2 to 480p on Quest 3. (I did turn resolution up to x1.5 on multiple games it didnt really make it look any better. Also no my computer did not have a hard time running it with higher res)\n3) Battery life: Worse and apparently according to reddit and other reviews battery banks like bobovr are being used up quickly as the headset dies while the external battery is still at 50% (I got about 1.5hrs before dead trying to use it with airlink after multiple runs)\n4) Passthrough: It's okay but super dependent on lighting. If you don't have lots of good lighting its looks like 240p.\nTLDR: RETURNED HEADSET. New to VR and it was Unimpressive for $500. Airlink is a large reason for the review, it's truly awful and I don't want to use it wired. I am also unwilling to shill out more money for Virtual desktop to 'fix' the issue, for $500 it should just work. Headset has marginal improvements here and there but if you're not already really into VR I'd say it ain't worth it for a casual user that wants to use it as a PCVR headset. At least at this current time maybe patches will fix my complaints but I'm not going to wait on a chance.", "author": "SaltySeaTurtle", "published": "2023-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": 2.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R3I8CY9MUQ79M5", "is_verified": false, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:43.251+02:00", "deleted": false}
