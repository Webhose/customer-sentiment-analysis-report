Original Oculus Rift, Samsung HMD Odyssey+ Windows Mixed Reality, HTC Vibe, Quest 2, etc.. . By far, Oculus has the best over balance of price, performance, features, and applications. If you are new to VR, this is the right product for you. If you are a Quest 2 owner (I have one) and have some extra cash to upgrade, this is also the right product for you. If you don't have the cash or just want to see what Quest 4 is all about when it shows up (I presume there will be a Quest 4 coming out in the far future), your Quest 2 will keep you going OK. For me the stuff that I like about the Quest 3 over the Quest 2 (and other products) is:\n- Pass through video. This is where the future is going. I think we are just seeing developers scratch the surface for what you can do this. I expect more \"AR\" like applications and games in the future. Right now, the available applications and games are few and simple, but I expect more in the future. I also like not taking off my Headset to do simple stuff like check my phone, grab my drink, check to make sure the kids aren't setting the house on fire, etc.. you get the point. Could Meta have done better with pass through? Yep, but for now it's good enough.\n- Optics/display. Any VR enthusiast will tell you that display optics/FOV/resolution are extremely important for a VR Headset. Just like you want a big, high-resolution TV to play games on for your console (or movies), same for VR. Quest 3 is a step improvement over the Quest 2 for sure. Is it amazing? It's better than most Headsets out there, but I expect all VR headsets to continue to improve on displays. For now, Quest 3 gets the job done.\n- Size. I can tell that the Quest 3 is smaller and better balanced (but not really lighter than Quest 2). I had a tough time taking my Quest 2 out of the house for trips and such. With the rings off the controller and slightly smaller headset, it travels better (but still bulky) than Quest 2. The controller size is a great improvement overall as well and helps with storage and travel.\nFor other things like audio, battery life, comfort, compute, etc.. Quest 3 seems comparable to Quest 2. I have seen folks say that Quest 3 battery life is shorter than Quest 2, but I have not experienced a big difference. Also I have seen some comments on the accessories and chargers used on Quest 2 not being compatible with Quest 3. I bought all new accessories for my Quest 3 since my son now has my Quest 2, so I did not have this issue. I will say that controller hand straps are pretty amazing, and I highly recommend them. I have also seen some comments on overall quality issues (like dead pixels, SW, etc), but for me I have had no real issues. SW/OS seems \"glitchy\" at times. It does weird things like drains my battery if I don't use my Headset for several days or has issues with switching to hand input mode from controller input mode when I don't expect, but otherwise it's OK.\nNow the not so good thing... VR in general is really early in development. There is really no \"got to have it\" story/application with VR. It's really still just a light gaming platform though there are some cool non-gaming applications like VR YouTube, Prime Video, Wander, etc... In general, all VR companies need to solve this problem long term to get VR in every home if VR is going to survive. Even if VR could replace some other electronic in my house (like my iPad) that would be a big improvement. Right now, if I had to cut my spending on Devices, VR is on the cut list (though I really like VR, it's still not as useful as other electronic devices).\nOne final note, in looking at Apple's VR future offering, I don't see that device as a Quest line competitor. No real games that I can tell. No controllers for gaming anyway. Seems like Pass-through and \"productivity\" focused though I don't know what productive things I would use it. The cost difference is huge as well. I am interested in seeing where Apple will go with their product, but I feel like they are trying to something different from Quest.", "author": "Alan Garner", "published": "2023-11-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 5.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R1Z3W23NOZ2CTC", "is_verified": false, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:48.725+02:00", "deleted": false}

Around the $500-650 price category, this VR headset is the most bang-for-your-buck you\u2019ll ever find for what you get in this package. Everything is so CLEAR and SHARP. Not even mentioning the pancake lenses that have infinite sweet spot and edge-to-edge clarity, zero god-rays, but the Quest 3 has almost as many pixels in ONE eye as the entire Valve Index\u2019s combined resolution. Talk about immersive. Comparatively speaking, if you are also thinking about getting the PSVR2 instead ($549), don\u2019t. Get this. I find my experience with this headset LEAGUES better than anything else I\u2019ve tried, and I\u2019ve tried them all. The graphical capabilities of this headset are mind blowing. At least in the games that are actually updated to take advantage of the Quest 3\u2019s hardware, you forget that it\u2019s all being run inside the headset. This is the closest you\u2019ll ever get to PC quality. To me, this headset after adjustment fits just right, and is way more comfortable than the previous Quest, despite being practically the same weight. Maybe it depends on your face shape, but this headset fits like a glove for me. The only way to top this headset is by spending 2x or 3x times as much money for another VR setup. And for this reason, this is a 5 star product for me. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f", "author": "I buy things", "published": "2023-11-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 5.0, "variant": "B0CD1JTBSC", "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R9FZJ6DC1RG82", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:48.753+02:00", "deleted": false}

First, they work with my glasses fine, but the Zenni lenses work very well, too. Are they better than using the Quest 3 with glasses? Read on!\nI got the Zenni's even though the Quest 3 fit over my glasses fine, just to have the option and for comparison. They arrived fairly quickly, well packaged and the prescription was spot on. I've used them for the past few weeks without any issues. I did have to re-adjust the fit of the Quest 3 to be looking through the lenses at the best angle, distance and eye width. It's like adjusting a new pair of glasses to your face. Once fit properly, it was smooth sailing. If you wear glasses, and spending $50 doesn't bother you, I would definitely get them to see if they work better or more conveniently than over glasses.\nNow, are they better than glasses? The Quest 3 fit over my glasses fine, which was a big change from the Quest 2 which fit terribly and lenses were a necessity. I didn't even need to adjust the Quest 3 outward to fit my glasses, so the FOV was fine. The differences in use were somewhat subtle. (1) Since the glasses were on my face, the fit tolerance of the Quest 3 was broader. It could sit a little higher, lower, or at a slight angle to my face and I still saw fine. The pupil distance didn't seem to matter as much for me - anything from 60-63 worked fine. With the Zenni lenses, the Quest is like a pair of glasses - the exact fit matters and I had to dial in the fit on the Quest and the inter-pupil distance exactly for a clear view and minimal eye fatigue. (2) FOV is subtly different. The Zenni lenses effectively sit a bit further from my face than a pair of glasses, which seems to slightly shrink the image the eye sees. Not enough that I cared, but it noticeable if you swap back and forth. The effect for you will depend on your own glasses fit vs the Zenni's. (3) For short sessions, or any time you are taking the Quest 3 on and off often, glasses are more convenient since you don't have to find and put them back on your face. Obviously, if you are sharing the Quest 3, glasses are easier, as well.\nBottom line: If you have any issues with using the Quest 3 with your glasses, get the Zenni's. If they work fine with your glasses, and there is a chance that it will, it might be a toss up, but I find it is a nice option and the lenses have pretty much stayed on my Quest 3 permanently.", "author": "DeKay", "published": "2023-11-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 5.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R1MXM4RZ5GB8TK", "is_verified": false, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:48.795+02:00", "deleted": false}

There are *so* many apps you can buy! There's absolutely a *lot* for everyone! It's a blast!\nIt easily creates boundaries in your room and it's so easy to switch between pure virtual reality and pass through, which is great for me because my cats keep wondering what I'm screaming about and try to help me and I don't want to step on my babies. I love every game I've played, and again, there is so much to choose from. I'm definitely encouraged to do more exercise, granted I've overdone it and hurt worse, but I'll heal in a day or two. Plus, you can play from a couch or bed, too. It's just so much fun!!! I love shooting aliens and zombies breaking into my house!\nMy father-in-law played this the other night and freaked out on a rollercoaster. Hilarious and definite TikTok material! He's in love with Meta Quest 3 and called to tell me he bought his own because it's so much fun!\nDefinitely the best purchase of the year!

I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.", "author": "horack", "published": "2023-10-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "rating": 5.0, "variant": null, "syndicated_text": null, "review_id": "customer_review-R270Y8RUU9JS4Y", "is_verified": true, "is_vine": false, "is_partner_review": null, "is_incentivized": null, "is_neighbors_program": null, "is_reviewer_program": null, "is_recommended": null, "had_tried_product": null, "is_sweepstakes_entry": null, "is_part_of_competition": null, "is_prize_draw_participant": null, "is_sponsored_rating": null, "is_seed_member": null, "purchased": null, "crawled": "2023-11-26T10:41:49.252+02:00", "deleted": false}
